 As we know, students in the first university cycles often face difficulties in adapting to the academic environment, which can negatively affect their performance. In addition, the large amount of information and the lack of adequate study skills can generate frustration and stress in these young people. Our project proposes a platform that integrates GP, Ford and Whisper, two advanced artificial intelligence technologies to offer tools such as automatic transcription of lectures, summary generation, personalized learning paths, and research and writing assistance thus facilitating adaptation to the university environment and improving study skills. We have developed a prototype in Python that demonstrates the functionality and potential of our solution. One out, each human cell has 1.8 meters of DNA in it, yet it fits into a cell that's 10 to 100 microns in diameter and it's bundled tightly up. So you'll learn how DNA in cells gets bundled up and wrapped around proteins that neutralize the negative charges of the double stranded DNA. This prototype allows transcribing lecture audios and generating learning paths using Google Cloud speech, text and G-Pete. Three apists, by implementing our solution, students will be able to improve their academic performance, reduce stress and develop more effective study skills. In addition, universities will benefit from higher retention and academic success rates, which in turn will contribute to a better reputation and attract more students. The market for grade apps is huge, valued at $5.76 billion. Our platform is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growing market by offering a comprehensive solution that goes beyond conventional grade application. Our project is aligned with sustainable development goal four, which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. By addressing the challenges faced by university students, we are contributing to improving the quality of education and promoting academic success. To incorporate G-Pete, four and whisper into our platform, we need access to apists, developers with expertise in AE, redes and platform architecture, as well as resources and time to adapt and optimize our solution. We're looking for support and investment to take our project to the next level and revolutionize the way students face academic challenges. In conclusion, our project has great potential to improve the lives of university students and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable educational future. Thank you for your attention.
