Clearly, I'm a total failure, not just in toasting bread but in life. I'm so clumsy and useless; it's no wonder people don't want to be around me.\n\nI got to work late because of traffic. As I walked in, I caught a glimpse of my boss's face, and I knew he was thinking, "Here's that useless employee who can't even show up on time." Everyone at work must hate me; it's the only explanation. To top it off, a meeting was scheduled for tomorrow, and I'm convinced it's going to be about laying people off. I'm sure I'll be the first one to go.\n\nMy colleague complimented me on my presentation, but she was just being nice. Any idiot could have done it, and it probably didn't even matter because I stuttered during the Q&A. My whole career is a joke, built on some lucky breaks."""
